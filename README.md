# Plant Species Diversity

A project to explore the diversity of the plants in Cazenovia Lake, and the effects of treatment with herbicide that specifically targets Eurasian Watermilfoil. This is a follow-up to my Animated Milfoil Map project, which can be [viewed as a video](https://youtu.be/Xel6vyh29CY) or [on Github to see the code](https://github.com/kgilbert78/milfoil-viz).

The data was collected in the annual "Rake Toss" aquatic plant survey conducted on the lake. Before being able to work with it, I [extracted the data from multiple excel files and cleaned it](https://github.com/kgilbert78/rake-toss-data-cleaning). My intent is to eventually integrate the Rake Toss data into a database with data from all the studies conducted on Cazenovia Lake in recent years.
